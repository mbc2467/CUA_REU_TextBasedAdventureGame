## IDEAS AND PLANNING DOCUMENT

EVENT PLANNING
week 1: 1 intro + 1 normal
    learn how to do research- read papers, watch demonstration
    meet grad students- choice of what to talk about
week 2-5: 2 normal + chance of 3rd
week 6+: 2 normal + larger chance of 3rd + chance of one of the events being major event

IDEAS: 
- ride on lime scooters around monuments
- calli/high schooler arrives in the 6th week
- hostile walking priest encounter on campus
- calling ms leslie (dream about birds pecking eyes out)
- tornado warning (window literally falls into kitchen)
- random chance you get caught in a 3-hour-long conversation with avnish or imran about something when they're bored
- add congressional baseball event (dems get cooked!)



CUSTOM EVENT CHOICES FOR SPECIFIC PEOPLE:
celine - able to eat bird/forage (diningHallID)
emma - 
mallory - softball skills allow for catching 7/11 slurpees and/or food thrown in garvey, computer arrival results in +2000% productivity
walker - skateboard skills give agility for dodging things, new chi-squared optimization model leads to breakthrough
james - exploration buff, networking with interns at CUA (charisma buff)
jacob - 
archie - 
marlena - able to talk her way out of a situation (improv + charisma)



2-3 intro week events
12-16 normal events
3-5 rare events
6-8 major events

SOME ONLY HAPPEN DURING CERTAIN WEEKS (include allowedWeeks parameter)
global meetings once a week on friday (early ones we watch or listen presentations/have discussions, later ones we have deadlines/have to present our progress)

research related - mentor gives extra work, mentor says your work is bad, weekly 'global meeting' deadlines
social - visit zoo, visit museum, other DC tourism stuff, ride segways around national mall, visit 7/11 for national slushie day, bird watch, movie night
personal - garvey dining hall is not open for any meals, friend comes to visit, ant infestation in dorm!
random/funny - pigeon in the lab, get a $5 palm reading from a psychic, someone (other intern (RARE: ronnie white)) tries to convert you to catholicism
big/impactful - midterm presentation (if vibes are good enough Dr. Yero lets everyone just read their abstract instead), visit to UMD visit (choose a lab to tour, maybe play hangman?)
